# Reverse a number using while loop
# Author: Amandeep Patti

# get input from user and store it in num
num = int(input("Enter an integer number : "))

# make a copy of num and store it in temp
temp = num

# initialize rev to 0 to store reverse of num


# loop until temp is greater than 0

# get last digit of temp

# add last digit to rev
# shift rev by 1 place to left and add last digit

# update temp by removing last digit


# print the reverse of num
print(f"Reverse of {num} is {rev}")

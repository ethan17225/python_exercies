# Rectangle Class
# Author: Amandeep Patti

# ToDo(s):
# 1. Create a Rectangle class with the following properties:
#   - length
#   - width
# 2. Create a constructor that takes in a length and width
#       and initializes the length and width properties
# 3. Create a method called calculate_area that calculates
#       and returns the area of the rectangle
# 4. Create a method called calculate_perimeter that calculates
#       and returns the perimeter of the rectangle
# 5. Create a main function that does the following:
#   - Prompt the user to input the length and width of the rectangle
#       and convert it to a floating-point number
#   - Create a Rectangle object with the provided length and width
#   - Calculate the area of the rectangle using the calculate_area method
#   - Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the calculate_perimeter method
#   - Display the calculated area and perimeter of the rectangle

# Sample Output:
# Input the length of the rectangle: 5
# Input the width of the rectangle: 5
# Area of the rectangle: 25.0
# Perimeter of the rectangle: 20.0

# Define a class called Rectangle to represent a rectangle
class 
    # Initialize the Rectangle object with a given length and width
    def __init__
        

    # Calculate and return the area of the rectangle
    # using the formula: width x length
    def calculate_area
        

    # Calculate and return the perimeter (circumference) of the rectangle
    # using the formula: 2 (width + length)
    def calculate_perimeter
        


# define main function and test Rectangle class
def main():
    # Prompt the user to input the length and width of the rectangle and convert it to a floating-point number
    length = float(input("Input the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Input the width of the rectangle: "))

    # Create a Rectangle object with the provided length and width
    rectangle = 

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle using the calculate_area method
    area = 

    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the calculate_perimeter method
    perimeter = 

    # Display the calculated area and perimeter of the rectangle
    print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
    print("Perimeter of the rectangle:", perimeter)


# call main function
main()

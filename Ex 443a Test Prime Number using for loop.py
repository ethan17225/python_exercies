# Test Prime Number using for loop
# Author: Amandeep Patti

# a number is prime if it is divisible by 1 and itself
# 1 is not a prime number
# 2 is the only even prime number

# get input from user and store it in num
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer number : "))

# assuming number is prime, initialize flag to True
is_prime = True

# loop from 2 to num - 1

# if num is divisible by i, set flag to False and break


# print whether num is prime or not
if (is_prime):
    print(f"{num} is a prime number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number")

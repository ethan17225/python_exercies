# ToDoList Class
# Author: Amandeep Patti

# Objective(s):
# 1. Create a ToDoList class with the following properties:
#   - tasks
# 2. Create a constructor that initializes the tasks property to an empty list
# 3. Create a method called add_task that takes in a task name and adds it to the task list
# 4. Create a method called remove_task that takes in a task name and removes it from the task list
# 5. Create a method called display_tasks that displays all the tasks in the task list
# 6. Create a main function that does the following:
#   - Create a ToDoList object
#   - Prompt the user to input few task names and add those to the todo list
#   - Display all the tasks in the todo list
#   - Prompt the user to input few task names and remove those from the todo list
#   - Display all the tasks in the todo list

# Sample Output:
# Enter a task name (or 'quit' to exit): Homework
# Enter a task name (or 'quit' to exit): Laundry
# Enter a task name (or 'quit' to exit): Cooking
# Enter a task name (or 'quit' to exit): quit
# Homework
# Laundry
# Cooking
# Enter a task name to remove (or 'quit' to exit): Laundry
# Enter a task name to remove (or 'quit' to exit): Cooking
# Enter a task name to remove (or 'quit' to exit): quit
# Homework


# Define a class called ToDoList to maintain a todo task list
class ToDoList:
    # Initialize the List object with an empty list
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    # Add a task with a name to the task list
    # Add a method called add_task
    # that takes in a task name as a parameter
    # and adds it to the task list
    

    # Remove a task with a specific name from the task list
    # Add a method called remove_task
    # that takes in a task name as a parameter
    # and removes it from the task list
    

    # Display all the tasks in the task list
    # Add a method called display_tasks
    # that displays all the tasks in the task list
    

# define main function and test the ToDoList class
def main():
    # Create a ToDoList object
    
    # Add tasks to the todo list based on user input in a loop
    # The loop will break when the user enters 'quit'
    
    
        # Prompt the user to input a task name
    

        # Check if the user wants to quit
    

        # Add the task to the todo list
    

    # Display all the tasks in the todo list
    

    # Remove a task from the todo list based on user input in a loop
    # The loop will break when the user enters 'quit'
    
    
        # Prompt the user to input a task name
    

        # Check if the user wants to quit
    

        # Remove the task from the todo list
    

    # Display all the tasks in the todo list
    

# call main function
main()

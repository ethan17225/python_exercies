# Testing Perfect Number using for loop
# Author: Amandeep Patti

# A perfect number is a positive integer
# that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
# For example, 28 is a perfect number because
# 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

# get input from user and store it in num
num = int(input("Enter an integer number : "))

# initialize sum to 0 to store sum of proper divisors
sum = 0

# loop from 1 to num - 1

# if i is a proper divisor of num

# add i to sum

# print the proper divisor and stay in same line


# print a new line


# print whether num is a perfect number or not
# if sum is equal to num, num is a perfect number

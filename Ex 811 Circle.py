# Circle Class
# Author: Amandeep Patti

# ToDo:
# 1. Create a Circle class with the following properties:
#   - radius
# 2. Create a constructor that takes in a radius
#       and initializes the radius property
# 3. Create a method called calculate_area that calculates
#       and returns the area of the circle
# 4. Create a method called calculate_perimeter that calculates
#       and returns the perimeter of the circle
# 5. Create a main function that does the following:
#   - Prompt the user to input the radius of the circle
#       and convert it to a floating-point number
#   - Create a Circle object with the provided radius
#   - Calculate the area of the circle using the calculate_area method
#   - Calculate the perimeter of the circle using the calculate_perimeter method
#   - Display the calculated area and perimeter of the circle

# Sample Output:
# Input the radius of the circle: 5
# Area of the circle: 78.53981633974483
# Perimeter of the circle: 31.41592653589793

# Import the math module to access mathematical functions like pi


# Define a class called Circle to represent a circle


class Circle:
    # Initialize the Circle object with a given radius
    def __init__(self, radius):

    # Calculate and return the area of the circle
    # using the formula: π * r^2
    def calculate_area(self):

    # Calculate and return the perimeter (circumference) of the circle
    # using the formula: 2π * r
    def calculate_perimeter(self):


# define main function and test Circle class
def main():
    # Prompt the user to input the radius of the circle and convert it to a floating-point number
    radius = float(input("Input the radius of the circle: "))

    # Create a Circle object with the provided radius
    circle = 

    # Calculate the area of the circle using the calculate_area method
    area = 

    # Calculate the perimeter of the circle using the calculate_perimeter method
    perimeter = 

    # Display the calculated area and perimeter of the circle
    print("Area of the circle:", area)
    print("Perimeter of the circle:", perimeter)


# call main function
main()
